= How to configure campaigns

== Introduction

This section provides the steps needed to manage the campaigns in the {app-short-name}.

{app-short-name} offers a REST Interface for the operator in order to configure the application.

All the configurations done through the REST API will be available through the {app-short-name} WebUI in the next release.

Before managing campaigns you must be authenticated to the {app-short-name} as an altiplano user.

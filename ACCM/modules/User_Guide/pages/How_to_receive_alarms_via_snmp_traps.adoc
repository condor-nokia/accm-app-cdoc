= How to Receive Alarms via SNMP Traps

== Introduction

This section describes how to receive the Alarms via SNMP Trap as an {vno-initials}.

When {app-short-name} is installed over Altiplano, the application creates topics per {vno-initials} in {app-short-name}'s Kafka service.
The Kafka Alarms are received by {app-short-name} and it must determine whether the alarm should be sent via SNMP trap.

To make this determination {app-short-name} checks the {vno-initials}'s configuration. If the {vno-initials} has defined SNMP trap destinations, the alarm will be sent to all configured destinations.
Refer to xref:How_to_configure_a_VNO.adoc#_configure_snmp_trap_destinations_to_isp[Configure SNMP Trap Destinations to {vno-initials}] section for more details.

= Solution Planning Guidelines for {app-short-name} Application

== What is in this documentation?

This section describes how to plan the deployment of the Nokia Altiplano's {app-full-name} on top of Altiplano Access Controller.
It also provides CPU, memory, and hard disk recommendations including dimensioning guidelines.

This document is intended for network engineers, planners, and IT staff who are familiar with the functionality of the Nokia Altipano {app-full-name} and
Altiplano Access Controller product and need to plan the deployment of an Altiplano's {app-full-name} on top of the Altiplano Access Controller.

== Solution Deployment Overview

As {app-full-name} App operates on top of the Altiplano Access Controller, this section will provide details that are specific to the
{app-full-name} Application that is required over and above the requirements for Altiplano Access Controller.
For more details on Access Controller Solution Deployment, refer to the section "Altiplano Solution Deployment Overview" in
the _Solution Planning Guide for Nokia Altiplano Access Controller and FastMile Controller_.

=== Compatibility

[width="99%",cols="49%,50%,options="header"]
|===
| *ACCM* | *Altiplano*
| {release-number} | {altiplano-release-number}
|===

== Operating System Specifications

Server and Client Software Requirements for {app-full-name} are the same as that of the Altiplano Access Controller.

=== Server Software Requirements

{app-full-name} can be installed on any server with major Linux distribution supporting Container runtime and Kubernetes nodes including RHEL (x86_64 platform only).
It is a microservices-based application that can be installed on the Kubernetes environment as a single-node or multi-node cluster setup.
The server should also have container runtime and Helm installed in it.

For the exact versions of Kubernetes, Helm, and Container runtime supported currently by Altiplano, refer to the "Getting started with Installation" section of the _Installation and Deployment Guide for Nokia Altiplano Access Controller and FastMile Controller_.

=== Client Software Requirements

{app-full-name} Application has a separate UI and REST APIs.
The client host requires any recent versions of the browser - Firefox or Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access the WebUI client of the {app-full-name}.

//== CPU, Memory, and Hard disk Recommendations for {app-short-name} Deployment
== Recommendations for ACCM Deployment

Refer to the _Solution Planning Guide for Nokia Altiplano Access Controller and FastMile Controller_ for the dimensioning guidelines pertaining to Access Controller and its associated micro-services.

The below tables provides *only* the additional CPU, memory, and disk requirement for micro-services relevant to {app-short-name} deployment.


[IMPORTANT]
====
This initial release has not been tested to support large scale of requests.
The idea is to use it as a demo setup with minimal resources consumption.
Refer to xref:Installation-and-Deployment-Guide:How_to_install_and_configure_ACCM_application.adoc#_configuring_helm_chart[Configuring Helm chart] section for more details.

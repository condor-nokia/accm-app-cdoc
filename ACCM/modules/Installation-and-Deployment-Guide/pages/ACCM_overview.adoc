= What is Access Cluster Campaign Manager?

The {app-full-name} ({app-short-name}) operates on top of {main-base-app}, and allows operators to define, schedule, and
monitor software update campaigns for network elements, in coordination with the Altiplano Software Management module.

== Solution components

{app-short-name} offers a configuration interface (REST API and UI) that allows the operator to configure the software matrices (target solutions) and
campaigns, and a core service that orchestrate the different download/upgrade activities within the campaigns following a specific order.

These components include:

* {app-short-name} Web UI (to be included in the Next release)

* {app-short-name} REST API Configuration Interface

* {app-short-name} Core

* {app-short-name} Persistence

For more information about the interfaces exposed by {app-short-name}, refer to the
xref:Installation-and-Deployment-Guide:appendices/ACCM_Exposed_Interfaces.adoc[{app-short-name} Exposed Interfaces] section.


=== {app-full-name} Web UI (to be included in the Next release)
Provides a user-friendly way for operators to define, schedule, and monitor software update campaigns.
It allows users to select target clusters, define software matrices, and view campaign status in real-time.

=== {app-full-name} REST API Configuration Interface

To configure the software matrices and campaigns, {app-short-name} offers a REST API to the operator.

This API offers Web and external integration purposes, enabling other systems to interact with the application.
Every operation is delegated to the core module, or Altiplano’s corresponding module

For more details on configuring {app-short-name}, see the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_ACCM.adoc[User Guide - How to Use {app-short-name}] section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For this initial release, only create/delete/retrieve operations for software matrices and campaigns are allowed using the REST API
====

=== {app-full-name} Core
It is responsible for managing and executing the orchestration tasks involved in software updates.
It handles the business logic for campaign creation, device exclusion, and update orchestration against Altiplano’s software management module.


=== {app-full-name} Persistence
It stores information, including campaign details, software matrix definitions,
element exclusion lists, and a history of all executed campaigns.

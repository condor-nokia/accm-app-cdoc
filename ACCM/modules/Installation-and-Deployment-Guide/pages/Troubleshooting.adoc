= Troubleshooting

This section provides information related to the troubleshooting of the {app-full-name}.

== Rollback previous version

If there is need to rollback to previous version the following command can be used:

.Usage
[source, bash]
----
helm rollback RELEASE_NAME [REVISION]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This operation does not rollback the database. If you are rolling back to a {app-short-name} version with differences in the DB structure, a backup/restore process on the {app-short-name} DB might be necessary for restory full {app-short-name} funtionalities.
====

.Example, if we want to rollback after install revision 2 we can execute:

[source, bash]
----
helm rollback altiplano-cm 1
----

== Uninstall

If there is need to uninstall {app-short-name}
execute the "helm uninstall" command:

.Usage
[source, bash]
----
helm uninstall RELEASE-NAME
----

.Example
[source, bash]
----
helm uninstall altiplano-cm
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This operation does not delete the database.
However, in case {app-short-name} is installed after an undeploy process, {app-short-name} will delete and recreate
the database from scratch.
====

== Inspect logs when error occurs
=== Inspect logs in Altiplano's Dashboards
{app-short-name} sends the application logs to Altiplano's fluentd.
To inspect application logs please go to Altiplano's dashboards and search for "accm" entries:

https://ALTIPLANO-SERVER/altiplano-indexsearch-dashboards

=== Inspect logs in {app-short-name} pods
By default, the application debug log is enabled for each pod.

To query a specific {app-short-name} pod execute the following command:

.Usage
[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs pod_id
----

.Example
[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs pod/altiplano-cm-controller
----

= {app-short-name} Exposed Interfaces

When {app-short-name} is successfully installed, the following interfaces are exposed:

== {app-short-name} Web UI (To be included in the next release)

Provides a user-friendly way for operators to define, schedule, and monitor software update campaigns.
It allows users to select target clusters, define software matrices, and view campaign status in real-time.

To access it you must enter the following in a web browser: +
link:https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-web-context}[https://{altiplano-host}/{accm-web-context},window=_blank]

For example if {main-base-app}’s public IP is {ip-host-example} the {app-short-name} WEB UI is available at: +
https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-web-context}[https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-web-context},window=_blank]

If additional IPs/hostnames were configured in chart variable ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST then
this interface will be accessible also using each of them

== {app-short-name} AC (REST API)

The {app-short-name} AC REST API allows an INP user to configure the {app-short-name} sending HTTP REST REQUEST.
To access it you must use the following URL: +
link:https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-ac-context}[https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-ac-context},window=_blank]

For example if {main-base-app}’s public IP is: {ip-host-example} the {app-short-name} AC is available at: +
link:https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-ac-context}[https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-ac-context},window=_blank]

If additional IPs/hostnames were configured in chart variable ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST then
this interface will be accessible also using each of them

== {app-short-name} Proxies

As {app-short-name} acts as a proxy for {main-base-app}’s IBN, PM and alarms interfaces, the next interfaces are exposed:

=== IBN

To use the {app-short-name} interface that acts as a proxy for {main-base-app}’s REST IBN the following URL is exposed: +
link:https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-ibn-context}[https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-ibn-context},window=_blank]

For example if {main-base-app}’s public IP is: {ip-host-example} the {app-short-name} IBN Proxy is available at: +
link:https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-ibn-context}[https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-ibn-context},window=_blank]

If additional IPs/hostnames were configured in chart variable ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST then
this interface will be accessible also using each of them

=== PM

To use the {app-short-name} interface that acts as a proxy for {main-base-app}’s REST PM the following URL is exposed: +
link:https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-pm-context}[https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-pm-context},window=_blank]

For example if {main-base-app}’s public IP is: {ip-host-example} the {app-short-name} IBN Proxy is available at: +
link:https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-pm-context}[https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-pm-context},window=_blank]

If additional IPs/hostnames were configured in chart variable ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST then
this interface will be accessible also using each of them

=== Alarms

To use the {app-short-name} interface that acts as a proxy for {main-base-app}’s REST Alarms interface the following URL is exposed: +
link:https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-alarm-context}[https://{altiplano-host}/{wnp-alarm-context},window=_blank]

For example if {main-base-app}’s public IP is: {ip-host-example} the {app-short-name} IBN Proxy is available at: +
link:https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-alarm-context}[https://{ip-host-example}/{wnp-alarm-context},window=_blank]

If additional IPs/hostnames were configured in chart variable ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST then
this interface will be accessible also using each of them

== {app-short-name} Kafka Brokers

The {app-short-name} includes a dedicated kafka service that allows the ISPs to connect in order to obtain alarms, PM data and intent health notifications.
This kafka is secured using SSL and SASL mechanism.

The exposed ports for the ALTIPLANO_SERVER ip or hostname configured when installing
are: 19093/19094/19095 (depending on the number of brokers configured when installing the application)

If IPs or hostnames are configured in the ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST variable of the chart, additional ports will be opened starting from 19096. One port will be assigned per broker in sequential order for each configured IP or hostname.

For example, if ALTIPLANO_SERVER is set to "{ip-host-example}" and
ALTIPLANO_PUBLIC_IP_LIST is set to "181.64.26.13;wnp-public" then the following
ports will be opened and assigned:

* When WNP installation was done configuring 3 brokers(wnp-kafka-broker replicas):
** For access via IP {ip-host-example}: ports 19093/19094/19095.
** For access via IP 181.64.26.13: ports 19096/19097/19098.
** For access via hostname wnp-public: ports 19099/19100/19101.

* When WNP installation was done configuring 1 broker(wnp-kafka-broker replica):
** For access via IP {ip-host-example}: port 19093.
** For access via IP 181.64.26.13: port 19094.
** For access via hostname wnp-public: port 19095.

To connect to these brokers and receive notifications see the xref:User_Guide:How_to_consume_Kafka_events_as_VNO.adoc[How to Consume Kafka events as {vno-initials}] section.

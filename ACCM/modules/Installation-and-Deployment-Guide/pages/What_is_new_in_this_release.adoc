= What's new in Release 26.3

* Introduced support for Live Collections. {app-short-name} can be configured by the {inp-initials}
to configure period, duration and max simultaneous live collections number per {vno-initials} or globally.
Also, the live collections can be executed by the {vno-initials} from the {wnp-ibn-context} proxy and WebUI over ONTs, Services and Troubleshooting sections.

= What's new in Release 25.9

* Introduced support for Intent input injection. {app-short-name} can be configured by the {inp-initials}
to set default values to intent fields per {vno-initials} or globally.
Also, the intent fields can be hidden to the {vno-initials}.

* The list of readable intent types can be now configured per {vno-initials} and globally.
When a readable intent type is configured the following actions are allowed:
** Query intents from IndexSearch inventory
** Query intent health from Opentsdb

* The readable intent types support the configuration of the allowed intent attributes per
{vno-initials} and globally. This allows to restrict the information of the intents
that the {vno-initials} can retrieve from IndexSearch.

* New feature to assgin network resources was added.
{app-short-name} can be configured by the {inp-initials} to allow the {vno-initials}s to access only assigned devices and fibers.
This configuration allows also to retrieve device and fiber alarms and metrics through kafka events of the assigned elements.

* Aliases can be set to devices and fibers assigned as network resources per {vno-initials}.
When the {vno-initials} has aliases defined, all the intent target occurrences are replaced
with the configured aliases.

* Introduced support to configure SNMP Trap Destinations per ISPs to receive filtered alarms via SNMP traps.

* Added support to acknowledge/unacknowledge alarms using the WNP Web UI and the IBN proxy.

= What is Wholesale Network Portal solution?

The {app-full-name} ({app-short-name}) operates on top of {main-base-app}, acting as a proxy for {main-base-app}’s Intent-Based Networking (IBN), alarms, and metrics interfaces.
The purpose of the application is to allow an Internet Service Provider ({vno-initials}) to access information related only to its network elements.
{app-short-name} can be configured by an Infrastructure Network Provider (INP) user to deny or allow operations based on specific values configured per {vno-initials}.

To separate information between {vno-initials}s, {app-short-name} needs to identify which elements belong to which {vno-initials}.
A transparent suffix scheme is used for this identification. When {app-short-name} is installed on top of the {main-base-app} solution, the call flow is summarized as follows:

== Solution components

{app-short-name} offers a configuration interface that allows the {inp-initials} to configure the application,
and different proxies for the {vno-initials} user to interact with {main-base-app}, applying the configured rules.
These components include:

* {app-full-name} Configuration Interface for {inp-initials}:
** {app-short-name} REST API
** {app-short-name} Web UI
* {app-full-name} Proxies for {vno-initials}:
** Intent Based Networking Proxy
** Alarms Proxy
** Performance Monitoring Proxy
* Kafka Filtering Module
* Kafka Brokers with filtered events per ISP
* {app-full-name} WebUI for {vno-initials}, which uses the application proxies to connect to {main-base-app}

For more information about the interfaces exposed by {app-short-name}, refer to the
xref:Installation-and-Deployment-Guide:appendices/WNP_Exposed_Interfaces.adoc[{app-short-name} Exposed Interfaces] section.

=== {app-full-name} Configuration Interface for {inp-initials}

To configure the application, {app-short-name} offers a REST API and a WebUI to the {inp-initials}.

To apply multi-tenancy features and other configurations/restrictions, the {vno-initials}s must be created by the {inp-initials} on {app-short-name}.
The {vno-initials} information consists of a name and an identifier.
This identifier is used in the transparent suffix scheme to ensure that {vno-initials}s only act on their own elements.

For more details on configuring {app-short-name}, see the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_WNP_as_INP.adoc[User Guide - How to Use {app-short-name} as {inp-initials}] section.

=== {app-full-name} Proxies

==== Intent Based Networking Proxy

{app-short-name} acts as a proxy for intents sent to the Altiplano IBN interface, allowing the application to apply any configuration restrictions based on the {vno-initials} sending the request.
For detailed information on this proxy, refer to the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_WNP_as_VNO.adoc[User Guide - How to Use IBN as {vno-initials}] section.
{app-short-name} can be configured by the INP to deny or allow specific intent-type operations based on the values per intent and per {vno-initials}.
See the xref:User_Guide:How_to_configure_intents_as_VNO.adoc[User Guide - How to configure intents as {vno-initials}] section for more details.

==== Alarms Proxy

{app-short-name} acts as a proxy to the {main-base-app} OpenSearch alarms interface, filtering the alarms that the {vno-initials} is allowed to see.
For detailed information on this proxy, refer to the xref:User_Guide:How_to_get_opensearch_alarms_as_VNO.adoc[User Guide - How to Retrieve Alarms {vno-initials}] section.
{app-short-name} can be configured by the INP to deny or allow specific alarm types per {vno-initials}. See the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_WNP_as_INP.adoc[User Guide - How to Use {app-short-name} as {inp-initials}] section for more details.

==== Performance Monitoring Proxy

{main-base-app} offers two ways of retrieving metrics: through OpenTSDB REST queries and Kafka notifications.
For detailed information on this proxy, refer to the xref:User_Guide:How_to_get_opentsdb_metrics_as_VNO.adoc[User Guide - How to Retrieve Metrics] section.
{app-short-name} acts as a proxy for REST queries, filtering the metrics that the {vno-initials} is allowed to see.
For Kafka notifications, {app-short-name} subscribes to {main-base-app}’s Kafka topics, filters the metrics, and writes them to a new topic on {main-base-app} per {vno-initials}.
The {vno-initials} then subscribes to its topic to receive the filtered metrics. See the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_WNP_as_INP.adoc[User Guide - How to Use {app-short-name} as {inp-initials}] section for more details.

==== Kafka Brokers with filtered events per ISP

For Kafka alarm notifications, {app-short-name} subscribes to {main-base-app}’s general alarm topic, filters the alarms, and writes them to a new topic on {app-short-name} Kafka per {vno-initials}.
The {vno-initials} then subscribes to its topic to receive the filtered alarms.

For Kafka metrics notifications, {app-short-name} subscribes to {main-base-app}’s Kafka metric topics, filters the data, and writes them to a new topic on {app-short-name} Kafka per {vno-initials}.
The {vno-initials} subscribes to its topic to receive the filtered metrics.

See the xref:User_Guide:How_to_consume_Kafka_events_as_VNO.adoc[How to consume Kafka events as {vno-initials}] section to understand how an ISP can subscribe to its topics and receive the filtered events.

==== {app-full-name} WebUI for {vno-initials}

{main-base-app} offers a WebUI that allows the {vno-initials} to use the proxies in a graphical way.
This WebUI acts through the defined application proxies to retrieve information only for the logged-in {vno-initials}.
For more information on this interface, see the xref:User_Guide:How_to_use_WNP_as_VNO.adoc[How to Use {app-short-name} as {vno-initials}] section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With the proper Workflow Manager configuration, the {inp-initials} is able to offer the ZTP workflow to the {vno-initials}s handled through the {app-short-name}. In this case, only the pre-provisioned ONT intents (whitelist strategy) with pre-provisioned L2-user intents scenario is supported.
